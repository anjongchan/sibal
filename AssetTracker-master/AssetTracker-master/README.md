_The Asset Tracker has a lot of features, but some of these aren't as straightforward to use as simple LEDs and sensors. This library abstracts a lot of the complexity and provides simple functions with broad capability. It wraps modified versions of both Adafruit's Ultimate GPS and LIS3DH Arduino libraries, as well as some novel functions._

## Examples

1. __GPS Features__ - How to use the GPS efficiently, and some nice Electron functions
2. __Accelerometer__ - Using the accelerometer with some cute tricks
3. __WakeOnMove__ - Waking up from sleep mode when the Electron is moved
